1. Overview

This repository serves as a centralized registry for **AI Skills**.
Unlike simple tool definitions, these skills are engineered to bridge the gap between a user's abstract requirements and the AI's concrete execution. They provide the necessary logic, context, and validation to ensure tasks are implemented accurately.

2. Directory Structure

The repository is organized by domain utility:
